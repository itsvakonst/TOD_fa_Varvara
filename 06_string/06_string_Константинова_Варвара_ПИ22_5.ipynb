      "\r\n",
      "i often make a double batch of icing the night before i have a baking project.  that way i know that i have plenty of icing, it’s fresh and i don’t have to make it while i’m in the middle of baking the cakes.  the extra can always be used for a batch of cupcakes.\r\n",

      "when you remove the icing from the refrigerator, you might notice that the icing has taken on a sponge like texture. do yourself a favor and place the icing in a bowl and mix by hand using a back and forth, smashing motion with a spoon or icing spatula. what you want to do is to smash the bubbles out of the icing. this extra step will help to give you the smoothest icing for a pretty top and sides of the cake. i have found that you will get an even better texture of icing if it is at room temperature before you try to do your icing.\r\n",

      "alligator claws are also a great name to call them if you have kids who either won't eat anything that sounds weird and you want to keep them to yourself, or - if you want your kids to eat them - if you have kids who'll only eat things that will gross other people out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
